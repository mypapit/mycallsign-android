    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=D2:14:8C:DC:4C:9C:09:BF:0B:7D:69:07:AD:A6:20:A3:97:5B:A8:AA%3Bnet.mypapit.mobile.callsignview.mycallsign

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    D2:14:8C:DC:4C:9C:09:BF:0B:7D:69:07:AD:A6:20:A3:97:5B:A8:AA;net.mypapit.mobile.callsignview.mycallsign

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
